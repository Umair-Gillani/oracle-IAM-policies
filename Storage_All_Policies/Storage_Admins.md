### **How to Confirm Each Policy**
After completing each step:
1. **Verify Action Permissions**:
   - If you can perform the required action without seeing "Authorization Failed" errors, the policy is working.
2. **Troubleshoot Issues**:
   - If actions fail, verify the user is part of the `StorageAdmins` group.
   - Ensure policies have propagated (wait 5-10 minutes and log out/log back in).
   - Double-check policy syntax.
