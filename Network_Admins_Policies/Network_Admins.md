     - Create, update, and delete VCNs, subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.
   - Test editing VCN configurations (e.g., add a new route rule or subnet).

---

### **2. Network Security Groups**
#### Policies to Verify:
```plaintext
Allow group 'NetworksAdmin' to manage network-security-groups in tenancy

### **Full Policy Set Summary**
Hereâ€™s the complete and validated policy set for `NetworksAdmin`:

```plaintext
Allow group 'NetworksAdmin' to manage virtual-network-family in tenancy
Allow group 'NetworksAdmin' to manage network-security-groups in tenancy
Allow group 'NetworksAdmin' to read instances in tenancy
Allow group 'NetworksAdmin' to manage load-balancers in tenancy

### **Expected Outcome**
- If the policies are correctly implemented:
  - The `NetworksAdmin` group should have full control over network resources.
  - Users can inspect and manage VCNs, security groups, DNS, load balancers, peering gateways, and logs.
- If any action fails, verify the policy syntax, propagation time, and group membership.
